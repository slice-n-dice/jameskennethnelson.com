    <h1>I wrote a book!</h1>
    <p>
        It's called Ninja Santa! 
        When I was in first grade, for a holiday-themed homework assignment, I 
        wrote a short story about Santa losing his red suit and becoming a 
        Ninja. In 2021 my parents excavated it with my other 
        grade-school mementos from a dusty closet. My sister-in-law Renee 
        thought the story was so goofy and silly that it HAD to be a real book! 
        So Renee, my brother Andy, and I set out to make our first children's 
        book. We fleshed out the story, hired an illustrator, and released it 
        in October 2022. My other brother Sam and sister-in-law Tyree 
        graciously built us an awesome website at 
        <a href="https://ninjasantabook.com/">ninjasantabook.com</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        The colorful and expressive artwork comes from the supremely talented 
        <a href="https://www.cariboou.com/">Abigail Roscoe</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        I guarantee that my little kid brain in 1999 never once imagined that 
        the story would be anything more than a grade for a class. Still a bit 
        shocked and grateful that it's a real book! I'm especially humbled 
        at getting videos from some of our customers, showing 
        their kids reading and striking Ninja poses around the house. 
        If the book inspires whimsy and fun and gets kids hooked on reading, 
        that's far more than I could have ever asked for.
